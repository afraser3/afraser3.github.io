I study fluid and plasma instabilities and turbulence in a wide range of physical systems. Lately, I've been particularly interested in turbulence in stably stratified "radiation zones" in stellar interiors, and in gas giant planets.

### Double-diffusive convection, and chemical mixing in stars

In my first postdoc with Prof. Pascale Garaud at UCSC, I began studying double-diffusive convection (DDC), a form of turbulence that occurs when two buoyancy effects with different diffusivities (usually temperature and either salinity in oceans, or mean molecular weight in stars) are in competition, with, e.g., a stabilizing (sub-adiabatic) temperature gradient and a destabilizing gradient of the other quantity (salt water over fresh water in oceans, or a mu inversion in stars).
