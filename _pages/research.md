I study fluid and plasma instabilities and turbulence in a wide range of physical systems. Lately, I've been particularly interested in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in stably stratified regions in stellar interiors (radiation zones), and in gas giant planets.

Below, I list a few of my recent research directions in no particular order.

### Double-diffusive convection, and chemical mixing in stars

In my first postdoc with Prof. Pascale Garaud at UCSC, I began studying [double-diffusive convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_diffusive_convection) (DDC), a form of turbulence that occurs when two buoyancy effects with different diffusivities (usually temperature and either salinity in oceans, or mean molecular weight in stars) are in competition, with, for instance, a stabilizing (sub-adiabatic) temperature gradient and a destabilizing gradient of the other quantity (salt water over fresh water in oceans, or a μ inversion in stars). The situation just described leads to one of two branches of DDC, known sometimes as salt-finger or thermohaline convection. The other form of DDC—where the temperature gradient is destabilizing (super-adiabatic) and the other quantity is stabilizing, is sometimes known as the diffusive branch of DDC, as oscillatory DDC (ODDC), or, by astrophysicists, as "semiconvection" (though note that "semiconvection" is sometimes used to refer to something that isn't exactly ODDC).

The role of both forms of DDC in astrophysical systems is covered very well by [this](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-fluid-122316-045234) review paper by Garaud, who also has [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08072) very nice set of lecture notes on the arXiv aimed at an astrophysical audience. A major facet that I care about is the anomalous chemical mixing ("extra mixing") inferred by observations of red giant branch (RGB) stars. As described in the above review (or see the introduction in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aca024) of mine), the deep interiors of RGB stars must host some form of turbulence in order to explain certain surface abundance observations. The leading candidate is thermohaline mixing, but predictive models for the chemical mixing rate of this process agree with *either* observations *or* 3D hydrodynamic simulations, but not both.

#### MHD thermohaline mixing and the FRG24 model
In Fraser, Reifenstein, and Garaud, ApJ 2024 ("FRG24"; [link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964..184F/abstract)), I collaborated with Prof. Garaud and UCSC student Sam Reifenstein to study the effects of magnetic fields on fingering convection.
