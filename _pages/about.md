Hello! I just started creating this website in earnest. Until this sentence is removed, I would say none of the links at the top are reliable, and are all coming from the template that I'm starting from.

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). I work with Prof. Pascale Garaud in the Applied Mathematics department. Previously, I was a PhD student in the Physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Profs. Paul Terry and Ellen Zweibel, and as an undergraduate I studied physics and math at the University of Oregon.

My research interests include astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics, and plasma physics, particularly turbulence driven by fluid and plasma instabilities. Turbulence is found in a wide range of systems, including stellar interiors, galactic outflows, protoplanetary disks, planetary atmospheres, Earth's oceans, and nuclear fusion devices. In these systems, turbulent eddies can significantly enhance the mixing rate of heat, chemicals, and momentum (AKA viscosity) beyond the levels one expects from diffusion alone. This can have important consequences in the surrounding system, like influencing the lifetime of a star, or reducing the efficiency of a fusion device. Despite the importance of turbulence in these systems, quantitative, predictive models (e.g. a formula for exactly how much turbulent mixing you get in some region of a star depending on things like temperature and density) remain elusive, and in high demand (engineers would love to be able to plan ahead by predicting turbulent losses before they build the next fusion device). 

My research involves both numerical simulations on supercomputers as well as analytical calculations (or "pencil-and-paper" math), which we combine in pursuit of predictive models that can be tested in simplified systems that are possible to simulate, and then extrapolated to realistic systems that even modern supercomputers can't simulate.

Presently, I am studying MHD turbulence driven by shear-flow instabilities and by double-diffusive convection (DDC), with the aim of either providing reliable, simple models that can be included in something like MESA (a tool astrophysicists use to simulate how stars change over time), or predicting observable consequences of DDC so that we can better establish which "missing mixing problems" are due to DDC and which ones require a different explanation.

I welcome participation from students. This kind of research is amenable to involvement from students with a variety of interests and backgrounds (e.g. projects with lots of programming vs little programming). If you're a UCSC student interested in working on this kind of stuff, don't be a stranger! Please reach out to me and/or Prof. Garaud.

In my spare time, my recent passion has become windsurfing. I also recently fell in love with sailing more broadly, including keelboat racing, and joyrides on 420s, lasers, and E-scows. When those activities aren't accessible I enjoy a good hike or bike ride.
