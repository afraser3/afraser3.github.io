Hello!

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). I work with Prof. Pascale Garaud in the Applied Mathematics department. Previously, I was a PhD student in the Physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Profs. Paul Terry and Ellen Zweibel, and as an undergraduate I studied physics and math at the University of Oregon.

Broadly, my research interests include astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics, and plasma physics. In particular, I study turbulence driven by fluid and plasma instabilities. Turbulence can be found in a wide range of systems, include stellar interiors, galactic outflows, protoplanetary disks, planetary atmospheres, Earth's oceans, and nuclear fusion devices. In these systems, turbulent eddies can significantly enhance the mixing of heat, chemicals, and momentum beyond the levels one expects from diffusion alone. This can have important consequences in the surrounding system, like setting the rotation rates of different layers of a star, or limiting the efficiency of a fusion device. Despite the importance of turbulence in these systems, quantitative, predictive models (e.g. by exactly how much the chemical mixing increases) remain elusive. Ideally, one would like to have a reliable formula that tells you, say, how much heat your fusion device is going to lose due to turbulence as a function of things like the strength of the applied magnetic fields. My research involves both numerical simulations on supercomputers as well as analytical calculations (or "pencil-and-paper" math), which we combine in pursuit of predictive models that can be tested in simple systems that are possible to simulate, and then extrapolated to realistic systems that even modern supercomputers can't simulate.

Presently, I am studying MHD turbulence driven by shear-flow instabilities and by double-diffusive convection, with the aim of providing a reliable, simple model that can be included in something like MESA, or predicting observable consequences of double-diffusive convection so that we can better establish what "missing mixing problems" are due to double-diffusive convection as opposed to other possible solutions.

I welcome participation from students. This kind of research is amenable to involvement from students with a variety of interests and backgrounds (e.g. projects with lots of programming vs little programming). If you're a UCSC student interested in working on this kind of stuff, don't be a stranger! Please reach out to me and/or Prof. Garaud.

In my spare time, my recent passion has become windsurfing. I also recently fell in love with sailing more broadly, including keelboat racing, and joyrides on 420s, lasers, and E-scows. When those activities aren't accessible I enjoy a good hike or bike ride.
